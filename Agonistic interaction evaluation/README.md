# Agonistic Interaction Evaluation

## Role

This directory is a core component of the `SecurePig` project, serving as the primary repository for raw data generated by the automated computer vision pipeline. The data contained here quantifies specific agonistic interactions among pigs.

## Overview

This folder contains automatically generated data files detailing agonistic behaviors observed in the pig pens. The data is organized into subdirectories, each corresponding to a specific type of interaction: displacement, fighting, and fleeing. These files are used to evaluate the frequency and nature of social interactions, providing key metrics for animal welfare assessment.

## Directory and File Details

This directory contains subfolders for each type of agonistic behavior analyzed.

*   **`Displacement/`**: Contains CSV files with data on displacement events. The `precision.txt` file contains performance metrics for the displacement detection.
*   **`Fighting/`**: Contains CSV files with data related to fighting interactions. The `Precision.txt` file contains performance metrics for the fighting detection.
*   **`Fleeing/`**: Contains CSV files with data on fleeing behavior.The `precision.txt` file contains performance metrics for the fleeing detection.

### File Naming Convention

The CSV files within each subdirectory follow a standardized naming convention: `PenID_YYYY_MM_DD_HH_0000.csv`.

*   **`PenID`**: An integer representing the pen number (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`).
*   **`YYYY_MM_DD_HH`**: The year, month, day, and hour corresponding to the start of the video recording from which the data was generated.

For example, the file `1_2025_02_04_11_0000.csv` contains data for agonistic interactions detected in Pen 1 on February 4, 2025, during the 11:00 hour.
