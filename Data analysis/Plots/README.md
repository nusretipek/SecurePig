# Data analysis\Plots

## Overview

As part of the `Data analysis` module, this directory provides visualization tools to represent the analyzed data, making it easier to interpret results from the analysis scripts found in other subdirectories (e.g., `Fighting`, `Movement`, `Section occupancy`, `Skin injuries`).

## Directory and File Details

This directory contains the following files:

-   `barPlotSectionOccupancy.py`: Generates bar plots to visualize section occupancy data, comparing occupancy rates between different treatment groups (Pheromone vs. Control) across various time periods.
-   `barPlotSkinInjuries.py`: Creates bar plots to display skin injury data, comparing total lesion scores between control and pheromone treatment groups across different periods.
-   `boxPlotAgonistic.py`: Produces box plots to visualize agonistic behaviors (fleeing, fighting, replacement) for control and pheromone groups, providing a comparison of these behaviors.
-   `boxplotMovement.py`: Generates box plots to represent movement data for control and pheromone groups, allowing for a comparison of movement patterns.
-   `linePlotAgonistic.py`: Creates line plots to visualize agonistic behaviors over time, illustrating trends and differences between control and pheromone groups.
-   `linePlotMovement.py`: Generates line plots to visualize movement data over time, showing movement trends and differences between control and pheromone groups.
