# README from analysis
## Overview

This directory contains the analysis results for Experiment 4, focusing on fighting behaviors between pigs. It includes visualizations, correlation analyses, and merged data frames derived from the raw data.

### Module Role

This directory is a subdirectory of `SecurePig\Data analysis\Output\fighting\Experiment4\` and contains the results of the analysis performed on the data within that directory. It provides insights into the fighting behaviors observed during the experiment.

## Directory and File Details

This directory contains the following files:

-   `circlingBehaviourBarChart.png`: A bar chart visualizing the circling behavior observed during fights.
-   `correlationAnalysis.txt`: A text file containing the results of the correlation analysis performed on the fighting data.
-   `mergedFrame.csv`: A CSV file containing merged frame data, including the Day, AnimalID, Score, CirclingScore, ScoreDiff, and CirclingDiff. The Day column represents the day of the experiment, the AnimalID column is the ID of the animal involved. The Score and CirclingScore columns show the score and circling score for each animal on each day, while ScoreDiff and CirclingDiff show the difference in score and circling score between consecutive days.
