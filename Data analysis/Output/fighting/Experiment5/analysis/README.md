# SecurePig\Data analysis\Output\fighting\Experiment5\analysis

## Overview

This directory contains the analysis results for Experiment 5, focusing on fighting behaviors observed in pigs. It includes visualizations, correlation analyses, and merged data frames derived from the raw data.

### Module Role

This directory is a component of the `SecurePig\Data analysis\Output\fighting\Experiment5` directory, providing in-depth analysis of the fighting data collected during the experiment.

## Directory and File Details

This `analysis/` directory contains the following files:

-   `circlingBehaviourBarChart.png`: A bar chart visualizing the frequency and characteristics of circling behavior observed during fighting interactions.
-   `correlationAnalysis.txt`: A text file containing the results of correlation analyses performed on the fighting behavior data. This file likely outlines relationships between different measured variables.
-   `mergedFrame.csv`: A CSV file containing a merged data frame, possibly combining data from different sources or time points. It includes the following columns:
    -   `Day`: Day of the experiment.
    -   `AnimalID`: ID of the animal.
    -   `Score`: A numerical score related to fighting behavior.
    -   `CirclingScore`: A numerical score related to circling behavior.
    -   `ScoreDiff`: The difference in score between two time points.
    -   `CirclingDiff`: The difference in circling score between two time points.
