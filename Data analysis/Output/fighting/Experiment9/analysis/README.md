## Overview

This directory contains analysis results for Experiment9, focusing on fighting behavior between pigs. It includes visualizations, correlation analyses, and merged frame data derived from the raw data.

### Module Role

This directory is a subdirectory of `SecurePig\Data analysis\Output\fighting` and contains the analysis results specific to Experiment9. It builds upon the processed data stored in the parent directory to provide insights into fighting dynamics.

## Directory and File Details

The `analysis/` directory contains the following files:

-   `circlingBehaviourBarChart.png`: A bar chart visualizing the circling behavior observed during fighting interactions.
-   `correlationAnalysis.txt`: A text file containing the results of correlation analyses performed on the fighting data.
-   `mergedFrame.csv`: A CSV file containing merged frame data, likely combining information from different data sources or time points. The CSV contains the following columns:
