## Overview

This directory contains analysis results for Experiment2, focusing on fighting behavior between pigs. It includes visualizations and data derived from the raw data files located in the parent directory.

### Module Role

This directory is a subdirectory of `SecurePig\Data analysis\Output\fighting\Experiment2` and contains the analysis results generated from the data in that directory. It provides insights into circling behavior and correlations within the fighting data.

## Directory and File Details

This directory contains the following files:

-   `circlingBehaviourBarChart.png`: A bar chart visualizing circling behavior observed during fighting interactions.
-   `correlationAnalysis.txt`: A text file containing the results of correlation analysis performed on the fighting data.
-   `mergedFrame.csv`: A CSV file containing merged frame data, likely combining information from different data sources for analysis. The CSV includes the columns Day, AnimalID, Score, CirclingScore, ScoreDiff, and CirclingDiff.
