## Overview

This directory contains the analysis results for the `ExperimentRemux8` experiment, focusing on fighting behavior between pigs. It includes visualizations and data files derived from the raw data.

### Module Role

This directory is a subdirectory of `SecurePig\Data analysis\Output\fighting\ExperimentRemux8` and contains the results of the analysis performed on the fighting data for that experiment.

## Directory and File Details

This directory contains the following files:

-   `circlingBehaviourBarChart.png`: A bar chart visualizing circling behavior observed during fights.
-   `correlationAnalysis.txt`: A text file containing the results of correlation analyses performed on the fighting data.
-   `mergedFrame.csv`: A CSV file containing merged frame data, likely combining information from multiple data sources for analysis. The columns include: `Day`, `AnimalID`, `Score`, `CirclingScore`, `ScoreDiff`, and `CirclingDiff`.
