## Overview

This directory contains analysis results for Experiment 6, focusing on fighting behavior between pigs. It includes visualizations, correlation analyses, and merged data frames derived from the raw data.

### Module Role

This directory is a subdirectory of `SecurePig\Data analysis\Output\fighting`, which stores the output files generated by the fighting behavior analysis scripts. This `analysis/` directory provides further processed and analyzed data from the main experiment data.

## Directory and File Details

This directory contains the following files:

-   `circlingBehaviourBarChart.png`: A bar chart visualizing circling behavior observed during fighting interactions.
-   `correlationAnalysis.txt`: A text file containing the results of correlation analyses performed on the fighting data.
-   `mergedFrame.csv`: A CSV file containing merged frame data, likely combining information from different data sources or time points within the experiment. The CSV contains the following columns:
    -   `Day`: The day of the experiment.
    -   `AnimalID`: The ID of the animal.
    -   `Score`: A score related to fighting behavior.
    -   `CirclingScore`: A score related to circling behavior during fights.
    -   `ScoreDiff`: The difference in the score.
    -   `CirclingDiff`: The difference in the circling score.
