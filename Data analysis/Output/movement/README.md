# Data analysis\Output\movement

## Overview

This directory stores the results of the analysis performed by the scripts in the `Data analysis/` directory. Specifically, it contains the output from the `Movement/` scripts, detailing movement patterns of sows in different experiments.

## Directory and File Details

This directory is structured by experiment. Each experiment subdirectory contains text files with movement data.

-   `Experiment2/`, `Experiment3/`, `Experiment4/`, `Experiment5/`, `Experiment6/`, `Experiment7/`, `Experiment8/`, `Experiment9/`, `ExperimentRemux8/`: Subdirectories for each experiment.
    -   `0_17.txt`, `0_2.txt`, `0_7.txt`, `0_9.txt`, `2.txt`, `2_7.txt`, `7_9.txt`, `9_17.txt`: Text files containing sow movement data from D0-D17, D0-D2, D0-D7, D0-D9, D2, D2-D7, D7-D9, D9-D17.
    -   `0_17_Naive.txt`, `0_2_Naive.txt`, `0_7_Naive.txt`, `0_9_Naive.txt`, `2_Naive.txt`, `2_7_Naive.txt`, `7_9_Naive.txt`, `9_17_Naive.txt`: Text files containing naive sow movement data from D0-D17, D0-D2, D0-D7, D0-D9, D2, D2-D7, D7-D9, D9-D17.
